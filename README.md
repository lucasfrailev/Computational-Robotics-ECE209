# Computational-Roborics-ECE209
# Lab Set 1
# We developed an MDP model for a robot which can move forwards or backwards in gridworld with its heading being discretized in mod 12.
# It can only change its heading by 1 unit in mod 12 after either going forward or backwards.
# To run our implementation one needs to download everything in this repository and run Main.m
# One can change the length and width of the world but not to less of 4x8 unless one wishes to move the obstacles, to do so one needs to
# edit ComputeReward.m
# One can freely change the goal to anywhere in the gridworld
